			<p class="special-content">Blue  Waters,  the  first  sustainable  Petascale  System  and  one  of  the  largest  and  most  open  systems  in  the  world, has been providing high quality service for over three years.  Not only is it a great resource the enables unprecedented  research,  it  is  also  an  experimental  platform  for  the  convergence  of  Extreme  Computing  and Big Data.  This talk will cover the experiences of the Blue Waters project and discuss the successes and challenges  in  merging  widely  different  workflows  on  the  same  system.  Finally,  it  will  explore  lessons  and  observations for next generations of Extreme Scale systems.
